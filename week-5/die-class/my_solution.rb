# Die Class 1: Numeric

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ]

# I spent [] hours on this challenge.

# 0. Pseudocode

# Input: integer representing number of sides of die 
# Output: die object; sides returns number of sides of die, roll returns random integer between 1 and # of sides of die
# Steps:
#check input number to ensure it is 1 or greater
# IF NOT - raise error (need to have at least 1 side on die - note, I'd say you need at least 2, but I'm not making the rules here.)
# ELSE set class sides equal to input number 
# sides method - return number of sides of die
# roll method - choose random number between 1 and number of sides

# 1. Initial Solution

class Die
  def initialize(sides)
    # code goes here
  end

  def sides
    # code goes here
  end

  def roll
    # code goes here
  end
end

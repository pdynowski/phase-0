> What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a basic visual guide that shows the major features of a web page. Generally, it will indicate where content will be placed, without showing the actual content. It generally also lacks any styling - the focus is on the function and layout of the page, not the specific styling and form of it.

> What are the benefits of wireframing?

Wireframing allows a designer to get an idea of how various potential page designs will look in practice, without having to build fully-realized HTML and CSS for each scenario. It's a much simpler and faster way to run through design ideas.

> Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

After I got past my internal editor that wouldn't allow any design to be "right" or "good enough", I did enjoy the process.

> Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I revised the design several times - the final design doesn't look very much like the originals at all

> What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

Nothing specific - the entire process was new to me, so I spent some time browsing the provided articles and links from them. Mostly, the question was "why spend the time to do this?" - browsing the sites was important to discover why (and *that*, even) professionals find the step to be vital, so that I can remember that it deserves focus.

> Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I actually enjoyed the design work, overall. Translating it/getting it into a copy on software was somewhat tedious, however. It may be that I should go back to a hand-draw-and-scan process for wireframing.

<!---
	What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	It's always good to see something you're building come together, especially when you're learning new things.

	How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	Researching them is fine, although we didn't really use any in the HTML for the website.
	
	How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)?
	Keeping to best practices was difficult, especially as we weren't entirely sure what qualified as formatting - for example, is recreating the two-column look of the original website formatting, or something that should be handled in HTML?
	It definitely CAN be handled in HTML, but we weren't sure if it should have been.

	What seems good and bad about HTML?
	Good: HTML seems very structured and straightforward.
	Bad: It seems like HTML can get very complicated once you move past simple website designs. 

	What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	The only real trick I use when writing HTML is adding the closing tag for an element at the same time I add the opening tag.

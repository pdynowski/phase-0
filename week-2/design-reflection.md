> What are the 6 phases of web design?

1. Information gathering - determining why the site is being made, who the intended users are, and what content should be included on the site
2. Planning - development of the site map and determination of which, if any, technologies to implement
3. Design - creating the look and feel of a website; usually involves wireframing the pages of the site. An iterative, collaborative process between designer and client
4. Development - where the design is implemented. generally, the home page will be developed, followed by a template for the other pages of the website. Still an iterative process, including developers, designers, and client. Technologies are included and implemented here.
5. Testing and delivery - making sure everything works, completing final details. Ensuring that the site is operational over diverse browser platforms and technologies. Search engine optimization and plugin installation generally occur here, as well.
6. Maintenance - update information or offer new content on the site. Also, perform site backups, upgrades, and install new technology if desired.

> What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary purpose of my site will be as a portfolio of the projects that I have created. It will feature either the projects themselves or links to them, as well as a blog where I discuss new things I've learned and how I've applied them.

> What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience is, ideally, developers and hiring managers looking to hire me for a job. My site should address them by making the relevant content (the projects and blog) easily accessible and convenient to view.

> What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

I think the primary action for the user of my site should be to view my portfolio. Therefore, the link to the portfolio should probably be the most prominent part of the site. Of secondary interest should be viewing the blog. Contact information for me should be prominently displayed in both of those areas, as, ideally, the portfolio and blog are what draw interest to me.

> What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience? What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

I'm tackling these questions together because it seems to me that they go together.

The main things that someone should know about design and user experience are that: one, the design of the website should be based on what is most useful and convenient for the user, not what "is awesome" or looks coolest; two: that a good user experience cannot make up for a lack of content, but all the content in the world is worthless if the user cannot easily access it due to poor design; and three: that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for a great user experience - it must be fit to the purposes and intended users of the website. It's valuable because a good user experience design can increase whatever the measurable goal of your website is, whether the goal is simple interest in your information, or the goal is increasing actual sales and dollars spent on a commerce site.

> Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Honestly, the worst part of the challenge was finding a Ubuntu-based program to draw the site map in. I ended up not liking any of the half-dozen I tried and instead using www.draw.io to make it.

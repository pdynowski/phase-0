     <h1>git, GitHub, and version control</h1>

     <h2>The fine art of keeping track of what's going on with your code</h2>

         <h2>What are the benefits of version control? </h2>

        <p>The first benefit of version control is that it makes collaborating on projects easier; instead of having an entire team of people each trying to coordinate when they can work on a file without conflicting with anyone else, everyone can make their changes concurrently and have them merged together later.</p>
        <p>Another benefit of version control is that it keeps track of what has changed in the project and when. Every time changes are committed to the project, and every time the project is merged, the changes are described, and a backup copy of the project, prior to the changes is stored. This also provides for the ability to restore the project to an earlier version, should the changes prove suboptimal.</p>
         <h2>How does git help you keep track of changes? </h2>

        <p>git helps keep track of changes through the commit process. A commit basically acts as a snapshot of the project at a moment in time. Furthermore, every time you commit something to the project, there should be a message indicating what the change was, and perhaps even why it was made.</p>
         <h2>Why use GitHub to store your code? </h2>

        <p>Use GitHub to store code for many of the same reasons that you use remote internet services to store other things: ease of access - you can get to it from any computer with an internet connection. It also makes collaboration easier, as anyone else with an internet connection can also get to it, meaning you don't need to have some expensive shared file server that you and all your collaborators have access to.</p>
        <aside>
            <p>On a somewhat tangential note, I was interested in learning exactly what git does to track commits, etc, and I found the following basic explanation:

                <br>Interesting, no?</p>

<!-- 
	What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
	I returned to tags like <main> and <article> often, and will use <header> and <footer> quite often when I get to formatting the blog pages. I use these most often because they are the tags/sections most likely to occur in general use, I think - almost every page will have a header and a footer, and main or article tends to define the content of the page well.

	How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

	How the elements get laid out on the page sort of depends on the styling used; default is that each element takes up the full screen width, with successive elements being placed further down the page (display:block) - this can be changed with various types of inline display (either inline or inline-block) that allow elements to be placed next to each other. It seems that browsers generally display elements "down the tree" - elements that are direct children of the html node are displayed first, then direct children of those nodes, and so on.

	What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

	I learned about the snippets, in general. I'm sure I'll be creating more of those at a later date. It seems like a handy tool to create not only the framework for html pages, but to create the framework for programs, as well. I have not yet checked on what other shortcuts exist in Sublime, but I definitely will.

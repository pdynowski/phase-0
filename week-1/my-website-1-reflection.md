> Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a repository on GitHub, one should go to their main page (https://github.com/<username>), click on the "Repositories" tab, and click the green "New" button towards the top right of the screen. That will take you to the "Create a new repository" page, where you should enter the name for your new repository, select whether you'd like the repo to be public or private, decide if you'd like to include a README in the new directory, choose the license you'd like to use, and finally, click the green "Create repository" button at the bottom of the screen.
Then, to clone the repository to your local computer, from the command line interface in a terminal, you would type "git clone <weblink>", and the repo would be cloned. The weblink can be obtained from the repository page on GitHub, near the lower right, in an area labelled "HTTPS clone URL"

> Describe what open source means.

Open source means that the work is just that - open. Anyone can see how it was made, and work with the project, making their own modifications.

> What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I'm not sure open source feels like utopia, but it's definitely interesting. Conceptually, having everyone be able to work on and improve programs seems like it should make them more useful - and, if no one else thinks something is useful, you can always do it yourself. I am a little concerned about the fact that it seems like open source makes it difficult for someone who comes up with a brilliant and useful solution to a problem to profit from that (directly, at least), but, on the other hand, if that's a concern for the creator, they obviously don't have to work on open source problems.

> Assess the importance of using licenses.

It's important to use licenses so that the rights and responsibilities of both the creator of a work and anyone who would add to or modify that work are clearly defined.
They also help protect the rights of the originator of a piece of software, and make it easier for others to contribute to the work on an ongoing basis.

> What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

This challenge helped to solidify the workflow for creating/committing content to GitHub - a few more, and the process should feel basically automatic. No notable light bulbs or struggles.

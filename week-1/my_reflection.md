> Reflect upon your learning by describing the terms below.

* Browser: software on a client computer that translates website from a (formatted) text file into a web page

* DNS: Domain Name System: the phone book for the web; correlates domain names with IP 	addresses

* Domain: "plaintext" name of a website, consisting of top level domain (eg .net, .com), and at least a secondary level domain (google, yahoo, etc)

* Internet: worldwide network of connected computer networks

* IP address: numerical label assigned to each device connected to the internet; currently most are of the form 255.255.255.255 (IPv4); as the 4 billion addresses this format provides are used, will be moving to IPv6, of the form ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff, where the entirety of the IPv4 address would fit into the final two ffff:ffff portions.

* Web app: an interactive, dynamic, and responsive website that generally needs to have access to various types of information and be able to handle that information; require databases and programs/scripts

* Web server: computer on which websites and web apps are stored. Responds to requests for information from other servers or clients connected to the web. Generally don't require local access (no monitors, keyboards, etc), so are often packed tightly into a room, density limited only be requirements for servicing and ability to cool the servers.

* Website: generally static, infrequently updated. Mostly for displays of information, doesn't require interactivity. Tends not to require database or much in the way of programming.

* World wide web: information-sharing network built atop the internet; generally consisting of webpages made of formatted HTML documents and multimedia content

So. How does a webpage get viewed? Starting with the person who wants to see the webpage, a request is made to see, say "http://www.blah.com". The viewer's computer then makes a DNS request to find out the IP address for blah.com; the domain name system responds with the IP, and a connection is made with the server at that address. A formatted text file is transmitted back to the viewers IP address, and this formatted file is translated into a viewable format by the browser that the viewer is using.

> What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
I learned that there's a difference between websites and web apps, and I learned a lot of information regarding IP addresses, which I will hopefully retain.

> How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
Mostly relieved that everything had worked; I've made websites before, so there wasn't a lot of feeling of "oooh, look what I did", or anything.

> Did you have an "aha" moment or were any concepts solidified?
Definitely shored up the difference between the web and the internet, and how the whole DNS thing works.

> Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I read over the Wikipedia articles regarding IPv4 and IPv6; beyond that, I used the provided resources.
